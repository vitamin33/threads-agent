# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

This is a portfolio project for educational purposes. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Create a private security advisory** on GitHub (preferred)
2. **Email**: Contact the maintainers privately (see profile)
3. **Do not** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
4. **Include**: Clear description, steps to reproduce, potential impact

## Security Considerations

This project is designed for demonstration purposes and should not be used in production without proper security review:

- API keys should never be committed to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- The included `.env.example` shows the structure without real values
- Review all dependencies for known vulnerabilities before deployment

## Known Limitations

- This is a portfolio/educational project
- Not audited for production security
- Some features are for demonstration only
- Always use your own security best practices when adapting this code
