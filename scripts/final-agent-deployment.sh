## Service Ownership ($(echo $services | wc -w) services)
$(echo "$services" | tr ' ' '\n' | sed 's/^/- services\//' | sed 's/$\//')

## Target Role
$target

## Responsibilities
**${agent_desc} Agent ($agent_id)**
- End-to-end ownership of assigned services
- Testing and quality for service group
- Documentation and monitoring for owned services
- Integration with other agent services

## Daily Enhanced Workflow
\`\`\`bash
# Start AI-powered session
export AGENT_ID="$agent_id"
just start       # Complete AI session setup + learning

# Service group work
just ${agent_id,,}        # Auto-focus on your service group
just tdd "feature"       # TDD for critical business logic
just save               # AI-powered commits

# Session management
just done               # Auto-commit + focus update
just finish             # Complete session cleanup
\`\`\`

## Job Strategy Alignment (AI_JOB_STRATEGY.md)
**Gap Plan Focus**: 
$(case "$agent_id" in
    "a1") echo "- Items 1-2: MLflow registry + SLO-gated CI (PRIORITY)
- Platform reliability and infrastructure scaling" ;;
    "a2") echo "- Item 3: vLLM cost/latency optimization (PRIORITY) 
- AI/ML service performance and content generation" ;;
    "a3") echo "- Portfolio building and technical documentation (SUPPORTING)
- Data pipeline development and analytics" ;;
    "a4") echo "- Items 4-5: A/B testing + revenue optimization (PRIORITY)
- Business intelligence and cost management" ;;
esac)

## Service Group Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Use service group assignments for efficiency:
just infra       # Infrastructure work ‚Üí A1
just ai          # AI/ML work ‚Üí A2  
just data        # Analytics work ‚Üí A3
just revenue     # Business work ‚Üí A4
\`\`\`

## Success Criteria
- Deliver high-quality features for owned services
- Maintain >95% development success rate with learning system
- Document achievements with business metrics for portfolio
- Demonstrate expertise in service group for target role
