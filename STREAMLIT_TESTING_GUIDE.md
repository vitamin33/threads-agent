## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **If "Run Demo" Fails:**
1. **Check virtual environment** is activated
2. **Verify demo script** works from terminal:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   cd services/achievement_collector  
   python -m mlops.demo_script --quick-demo
   ```
3. **Restart Streamlit** if needed

### **If No Logs Appear:**
- **Wait 5-10 seconds** - background process takes time
- **Click Reset** and try again
- **Check console** for Python errors

### **If Metrics Don't Update:**
- **Refresh browser** page
- **Check demo actually completed**
- **Verify demo_output/ files** were generated
