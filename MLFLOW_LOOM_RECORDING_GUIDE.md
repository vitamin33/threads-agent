# MLflow Lifecycle Demo - Loom Recording Guide

## ðŸŽ¥ 2-Minute Loom Recording Script

### Pre-Recording Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Terminal Setup**
   ```bash
   # Open terminal in project root
   cd /Users/vitaliiserbyn/development/wt-a1-mlops
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   source mlops_venv/bin/activate
   
   # Clear terminal for clean recording
   clear
   ```

2. **Browser Setup**
   - Open MLflow UI tab (if available): http://localhost:5000
   - Open Grafana dashboard tab (if available): http://localhost:3000
   - Have LinkedIn/portfolio site ready for context

### Recording Script (2 minutes)

#### Opening (10 seconds)
"Hi, I'm demonstrating an MLflow lifecycle management system I built that handles the complete ML model lifecycle - from training through evaluation, promotion, and automated rollback."

#### Demo Execution (40 seconds)
```bash
# Run the demo
python services/achievement_collector/mlops/demo_script.py --quick-demo
```

**Narration while running:**
"This system trains multiple ML models - RandomForest, XGBoost, and LogisticRegression - with comprehensive MLflow tracking. Notice how it automatically validates SLO compliance, checking that p95 latency stays under 500 milliseconds and accuracy exceeds 85%."

#### Key Features Highlight (40 seconds)
**Point out on screen:**
- "The system implements a complete promotion pipeline: dev â†’ staging â†’ production"
- "Each stage has automated SLO validation gates"
- "Watch the automated rollback - when performance degrades, it detects the regression and rolls back in under 30 seconds"
- "All metrics are tracked in MLflow with PostgreSQL backend for production readiness"

#### Results & Artifacts (20 seconds)
"The demo generates comprehensive artifacts including:
- Training results with model comparisons
- SLO compliance reports
- Promotion audit logs
- Rollback timelines

This ensures complete observability and compliance for production ML systems."

#### Closing (10 seconds)
"This demonstrates production-ready MLOps practices including experiment tracking, model versioning, automated deployment, and performance monitoring - all critical for maintaining ML systems at scale."

### Post-Recording Checklist
- [ ] Loom recording is exactly 2 minutes or less
- [ ] Audio is clear with no background noise
- [ ] Terminal text is readable (zoom in if needed)
- [ ] Demo runs without errors
- [ ] Key SLO metrics are visible
- [ ] Portfolio link added to description

### Loom Recording Tips
1. **Use Loom's editing features** to trim any delays
2. **Add chapters** for: Training, Evaluation, Promotion, Rollback
3. **Include a call-to-action** in description: "View full code at [GitHub link]"
4. **Set thumbnail** to the colorful demo completion screen

### LinkedIn Post Template
```
ðŸš€ Just built an end-to-end MLflow lifecycle management system!

Watch the 2-minute demo showing:
âœ… Multi-model training with automatic tracking
âœ… SLO-based promotion gates (p95 < 500ms)
âœ… Automated rollback on performance regression
âœ… Complete audit trail and observability

Key achievements:
â€¢ 0.4s demo execution (optimized from 90s)
â€¢ 3 ML algorithms with comparative analysis
â€¢ Production-ready with PostgreSQL backend
â€¢ Kubernetes-ready deployment

This demonstrates critical MLOps skills: experiment tracking, model versioning, automated deployment, and performance monitoring.

## ðŸŽ¯ Portfolio Impact

### For MLOps Engineer Roles
- **Demonstrates**: Production ML lifecycle management
- **Technologies**: MLflow, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Python
- **Best Practices**: SLO gates, automated rollback, experiment tracking
- **Metrics**: Latency monitoring, accuracy tracking, version control

### Interview Talking Points
1. **Challenge**: "How do you manage model deployment risk?"
   - **Answer**: "I implemented SLO-based promotion gates with automated rollback, as shown in my MLflow demo..."

2. **Challenge**: "How do you track ML experiments?"
   - **Answer**: "I use MLflow with PostgreSQL backend for production-grade tracking, demonstrating with 3 different algorithms..."

3. **Challenge**: "How do you handle model performance regression?"
   - **Answer**: "I built automated monitoring that detects regression and rolls back in under 30 seconds..."

## ðŸ“Š Technical Details

### What the Demo Showcases
- **Model Training**: 3 algorithms (RandomForest, XGBoost, LogisticRegression)
- **Metrics Tracked**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Latency (p50, p95, p99)
- **SLO Requirements**: 
  - Accuracy > 85%
  - p95 latency < 500ms
  - Rollback time < 30s
- **Stages**: dev â†’ staging â†’ production
