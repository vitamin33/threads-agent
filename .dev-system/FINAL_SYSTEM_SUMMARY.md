## 🔄 **Your Enhanced 4-Worktree Workflow**

### **Multi-Agent Coordination Enhanced:**

**Previous Setup:**
```
wt-a1-mlops     → Manual coordination, unclear dependencies
wt-a2-genai     → Isolated quality checks, potential conflicts
wt-a3-analytics → No systematic quality management
wt-a4-platform  → Manual deployment sequencing
```

**Enhanced with Agent Factory:**
```
wt-a1-mlops     → Infrastructure agent with deployment priority
├── just eval-agents "orchestrator celery_worker"
├── just release staging (deploys first)
└── just brief (infrastructure priorities)

wt-a2-genai     → AI/ML agent with prompt governance  
├── just eval-agents "persona_runtime viral_engine rag_pipeline"
├── just prompt-test persona_runtime content_generation
└── just knowledge-search "machine learning"

wt-a3-analytics → Data agent with achievement tracking
├── just eval-agents "achievement_collector dashboard_api"  
├── just knowledge-search "data analytics"
└── just quality-weekly (system health)

wt-a4-platform  → Business agent with safe revenue changes
├── just eval-agents "revenue finops_engine"
├── just release canary 5 (conservative for revenue)
└── just safety-check (extra protection for business logic)
```

### **Agent-Specific Daily Workflows:**

**Morning in each worktree:**
```bash
# 1. Agent-specific health check
export AGENT_ID=a1 && just brief              # Tailored priorities
just metrics-today                             # System-wide health

# 2. Test agent-specific services
just eval-agents "$(agent-services)"           # Only test your services
just prompt-list-agent $(primary-service)      # Your prompt versions

# 3. Knowledge for your domain
just knowledge-search "$(agent-focus-keyword)" # Domain-specific knowledge
```

**Evening coordination:**
```bash
# 1. Individual agent debrief
just debrief                                   # Your productivity + outcomes

# 2. System-wide coordination (any agent can run):
just eval-all                                  # Full system quality
just quality-weekly                            # Cross-agent trends
```

## 💡 **Key Improvements for Multi-Agent Development**

### **1. Quality Coordination**
- **Before**: Each agent tests separately, unclear system impact
- **After**: `just eval-all` shows all agents, `just quality-weekly` shows trends

### **2. Deployment Sequencing**
- **Before**: Manual coordination, potential conflicts
- **After**: `just release staging` (A1 first), then others deploy safely

### **3. Knowledge Sharing**
- **Before**: Isolated knowledge per agent
- **After**: Shared corpus with agent-specific search relevance

### **4. Performance Correlation**
- **Before**: No visibility into cross-agent performance impact
- **After**: M1 telemetry shows system-wide impact of changes

## 🚀 **Complete Command Reference**

### **Daily Essentials:**
```bash
just brief                          # AI-powered daily priorities
just metrics-today                  # System health check
just debrief                        # Evening productivity analysis
```

### **Quality Management:**
```bash
just eval-all                       # Test all agents
just eval-agents "service1 service2"  # Test specific services
just quality-weekly                 # Quality trends and insights
```

### **Deployment & Safety:**
```bash
just release canary 10              # Safe deployment with monitoring
just safety-check                   # Security validation
just release-history                # Deployment success tracking
```

### **Prompt & Knowledge:**
```bash
just prompt-test agent prompt       # Validate prompt changes
just knowledge-search "query"       # Find reliable, attributed knowledge
```
