title: "Calculation Transparency Engine"
description: |
  Comprehensive calculation transparency system that provides detailed breakdowns of achievement
  scoring methodology, business value calculations, and impact assessments. This system makes
  the black-box achievement scoring transparent and auditable, enabling users to understand
  exactly how their achievements are valued and providing insights for optimization.
