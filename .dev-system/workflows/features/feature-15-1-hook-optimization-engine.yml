title: "Hook Optimization Engine"
description: |
  AI-powered hook optimization engine that analyzes content hooks, generates alternatives,
  performs A/B testing, and provides performance predictions. This system integrates with
  the viral_engine service to leverage pattern analysis and engagement prediction models
  for maximizing hook effectiveness and content engagement rates.
