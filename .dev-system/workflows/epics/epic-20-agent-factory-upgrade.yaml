title: "Top-1% Agent Factory: AI Development System Upgrade"
description: |
  Transform the current 4-agent AI development system into a top-1% "agent factory" level platform.
  This epic focuses on the 20% effort that delivers 80% of the benefits: agent evaluations, 
  telemetry, prompt governance, and productivity automation to accelerate development speed 
  and quality while maintaining the existing ultra-friendly command interface.

  - feature-20-6-release-strategy-upgrade

dependencies:
  - "4-agent parallel development system (existing)"
  - "Learning system with pattern tracking (existing)" 
  - "Ultra-friendly justfile commands (existing)"
  - "Achievement collector with real data (existing)"
  - "AI development acceleration scripts (existing)"
  - "MCP servers infrastructure (existing)"

technical_requirements:
  - "Maintain existing justfile command interface"
  - "Build on current 4-agent worktree system"
  - "Integrate with learning-system.sh analytics"
  - "Preserve ultra-fast development feedback loops"
  - "Support current service architecture (33 services)"

success_criteria:
  - "Block merges on evaluation regression with automated gates"
  - "Track tokens, latency, and cost per AI operation with 5-second dashboards"
  - "Version control 90% of prompts with contract testing"
  - "One-command environment spin-up in under 60 seconds"
  - "3x improvement in development cycle time"
  - "Demonstrate top-1% AI engineering practices in portfolio"

risks_and_mitigations:
  risks:
    - "Adding complexity to simple workflow"
    - "Performance overhead from telemetry"
    - "Breaking existing ultra-friendly commands"
  mitigations:
    - "Maintain backward compatibility with existing commands"
    - "Use async telemetry with minimal performance impact"
    - "Add complexity as optional layers, not required workflow changes"

implementation_approach:
  phase_1_quick_wins: "Basic evals + simple telemetry (80/20 rule focus)"
  phase_2_governance: "Prompt versioning + automated quality gates"
  phase_3_excellence: "Advanced observability + productivity automation"
  rollback_strategy: "Feature flags for all new capabilities"
