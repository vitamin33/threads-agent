id: "epic-282-emotion-trajectory-mapping"
title: "Advanced Emotion Trajectory Mapping for Viral Content Optimization"
status: "planned"
priority: "high"
type: "epic"
created_date: "2025-08-03"
target_completion: "2025-11-15"

# Epic Description
description: |
  Advanced emotion trajectory mapping system that transforms basic emotion detection into sophisticated 
  emotional intelligence for viral content creation. This system will analyze emotional progressions,
  identify optimal emotion pacing patterns, and provide real-time emotion optimization recommendations
  to dramatically improve content engagement and virality potential.

# Business Value Proposition  
business_value: 92
business_justification: |
  Emotion-driven content generates 2-3x higher engagement rates than standard content. By mapping
  emotion trajectories and optimizing emotional pacing, we can:
  - Increase engagement rates from current 6% to target 10%+
  - Reduce cost per follow from $0.01 to $0.007
  - Generate additional $15k MRR through higher converting emotional content
  - Enable data-driven emotion optimization vs current intuition-based approach

# Technical Complexity Assessment
complexity_score: 88
complexity_justification: |
  High complexity due to:
  - Multi-model ML pipeline integration (BERT, RoBERTa, VADER)
  - Real-time temporal emotion analysis with time-series processing
  - Sophisticated pattern recognition and template generation
  - Integration with existing viral_pattern_engine service
  - Performance optimization for <300ms processing requirements
  - Multi-language emotion detection support
