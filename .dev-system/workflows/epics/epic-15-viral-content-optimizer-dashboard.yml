title: "Viral Content Optimizer Dashboard"
description: |
  Advanced AI-powered viral content optimization dashboard that provides real-time hook optimization,
  engagement prediction, content quality gates, and pattern analytics. This system integrates with
  the existing viral_engine service to provide data-driven insights for maximizing content virality
  and engagement rates, directly supporting the 6%+ engagement KPI target.

  Key capabilities include:
  - Hook Optimization Tool with A/B testing and performance prediction
  - AI-powered Engagement Predictor using historical data and ML models
  - Automated Content Quality Gate with multi-criteria scoring
  - Pattern Analytics Dashboard for viral content insights
  - Real-time performance monitoring and optimization recommendations
