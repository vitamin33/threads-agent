Use k3d for local Kubernetes development\n    2. Run `just dev-start` to bootstrap environment\n    3. Deploy with `just deploy-dev` \n    4. Monitor with `just logs`\n    5. Test with `just e2e`\n    \n    ## Performance Targets\n    \n    - Content generation: < 30s end-to-end\n    - Engagement prediction: < 5s\n    - API response time: < 2s\n    - Cost per post: < $0.05",
