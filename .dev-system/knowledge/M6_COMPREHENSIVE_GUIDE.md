## 📅 **How M6 Transforms Your Workflow**

### **Before M6:**
```bash
# When agents give outdated/wrong info:
"Why did my agent mention React 16 when React 18 is current?"
# Manual investigation, no source tracking
# Agents could hallucinate information
```

### **After M6:**
```bash
# Morning brief shows knowledge issues:
just brief
# Output: "🔍 Update Stale Knowledge Sources (ICE: 14.0)
#          3 sources need updating
#          📋 Action: just knowledge-validate"

# Investigate and fix:
just knowledge-validate              # See exactly which sources are stale
just knowledge-search "React"        # Find outdated React info
just knowledge-add "React 18 Guide" "Latest React 18 features..."
# Now agents cite: "Source: React 18 Guide (updated today)"
```

### **Agent Responses Now Include:**
- **Source attribution**: "According to AI Development Best Practices (updated 2 hours ago)..."
- **Freshness indicators**: "Source last validated: Today"
- **Quality scores**: "High confidence source (validity: 0.95)"

## 💰 **Business Value Delivered**
