Iterative refinement based on results\n    \n    ## Model Selection\n    \n    Choose models based on:\n    - Task complexity (GPT-3.5 for simple, GPT-4 for complex)\n    - Cost considerations ($0.002/1K tokens for GPT-3.5)\n    - Latency requirements (GPT-3.5 faster)\n    - Quality requirements (GPT-4 higher quality)\n    \n    ## Safety Considerations\n    \n    Always implement:\n    - Rate limiting to prevent abuse\n    - Content filtering for safety\n    - Cost monitoring and alerts\n    - Quality gates for production\n    ",

Use k3d for local Kubernetes development\n    2. Run `just dev-start` to bootstrap environment\n    3. Deploy with `just deploy-dev` \n    4. Monitor with `just logs`\n    5. Test with `just e2e`\n    \n    ## Performance Targets\n    \n    - Content generation: < 30s end-to-end\n    - Engagement prediction: < 5s\n    - API response time: < 2s\n    - Cost per post: < $0.05\n    ",
