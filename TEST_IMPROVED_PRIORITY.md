# Test: Improved Business Value Calculation Priority

## Summary
This PR tests the **improved calculation priority** and **enhanced team detection** fixes for the business value system.

## Business Impact
This automated deployment system **saves 4 hours per week for senior developers** in our **6-person development team**. The improvements eliminate manual processes and reduce deployment complexity.

## Expected Calculation
With the priority fixes, this should now calculate:
- **Hours**: 4 hours per week
- **Period**: Weekly (52 weeks/year)  
- **Role**: Senior developers ($125/hour)
- **Team**: 6-person team (multiplier = 6)
- **Total**: 4 × 52 × $125 × 6 = **$156,000/year**

## Previous vs Current
- **Before**: Found "$125" from text → $125/year (wrong)
- **After**: Should calculate time savings first → $156,000/year (correct)

## Test Validation
This tests:
1. **Priority fix**: Time savings calculation runs before explicit value extraction
2. **Team detection**: "6-person development team" → team_multiplier = 6
3. **Role detection**: "senior developers" → hourly_rate = $125
4. **Pattern matching**: "saves 4 hours per week for senior developers"
5. **Confidence**: Should be medium (0.7) for calculated value vs high (0.9) for explicit
