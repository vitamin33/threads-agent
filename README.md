## ✨ What is this?

> **Threads-Agent Stack** – a full-stack, multi-persona AI agent that
> researches trends ➜ writes & posts content ➜ measures ROI – all on a
> production-grade Kubernetes architecture.
> 
> **This is a portfolio project** demonstrating:
> - Microservices architecture with Kubernetes (k3d/k8s)
> - AI/ML integration (LangGraph, OpenAI, vector databases)
> - Production monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
> - Test-driven development (90%+ coverage)
> - CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions

_Micro-services:_ Orchestrator · Persona-runtime (LangGraph + LoRA) · Revenue (Stripe + Affiliate) · Bandit
online A/B · Trend & Pain Flywheel · FinOps board · SRE/Chaos add-ons.

### 🤖 **NEW: AI-Powered Development System**

Revolutionary development workflow with **GPT-4 planning** + **auto-git integration**:

```bash
# AI creates complete project plans in 30 seconds
./scripts/workflow-automation.sh ai-plan "Build payment processing system"
# → Creates epic with 5 features and 15 tasks automatically

# Zero-friction development workflow
./scripts/workflow-automation.sh tasks start task_001    # Auto-branch + setup
# ... code your feature ...
./scripts/workflow-automation.sh tasks commit task_001 "add stripe integration" # Enhanced commits
./scripts/workflow-automation.sh tasks ship task_001    # Auto-PR with rich descriptions
```

**Result**: 10x faster from idea to shipped code! 🚀

✅ **AI Planning**: GPT-4 breaks down requirements into epics/features/tasks
✅ **Auto-Git**: Smart branching, enhanced commits, rich PRs
✅ **Local Management**: YAML-based epic tracking (no external tools needed)
✅ **Team Collaboration**: Task assignment and progress tracking

## 🖼 Architecture (dev vs prod)

![infra diagram](docs/infra.svg)

- **Local dev** → `k3d` (K3s in Docker), Helm mono-chart, OTEL → Jaeger.
- **Stage / Prod** → AWS EKS spot, Aurora Sls, Qdrant + replica, autoscale,
  Vault + external-secrets.

## ⚡ Quick-start (local)

### 🎯 NEW: 80/20 Productivity Mode
```bash
# Business automation (content + revenue):
just work-day        # Start everything (morning)
just create-viral    # AI creates viral content
just make-money      # Run business on autopilot

# Development automation (AI planning + auto-git):
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
./scripts/workflow-automation.sh ai-plan "your feature idea"  # AI plans everything
./scripts/workflow-automation.sh tasks start task_001        # Start coding

# See: CLAUDE.md for complete development workflow guide
```

### Traditional Setup
```bash
# 0 · prereqs: Docker >= 24, k3d >= 5.6, Helm >= 3.14, Python 3.11
git clone https://github.com/vitalii-serbyn/threads-agent.git
cd threads-agent
just bootstrap        # → k3d cluster dev
just deploy-dev       # → helm install threads
just test             # → pytest (unit + e2e)
open http://localhost:16686   # Jaeger UI
```

### 🎨 NEW: Streamlit UI Dashboard
```bash
# One-time setup
just ui-setup         # Install dependencies & configure

# Run dashboard (after services are deployed)
just ui-dashboard     # Opens at http://localhost:8501

# Other UI commands
just ui-docker        # Run dashboard in Docker
just ui-deploy        # Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
just ui-port-forward  # Access dashboard from k8s
```

The dashboard provides:
- 📊 Real-time KPIs and metrics
- 🏆 Achievement tracking and management  
- 📝 AI-powered content generation
- 📈 Performance analytics
- 🔧 System health monitoring

**Environment Configuration**: Copy `dashboard/.env.example` to `dashboard/.env` and update based on your setup:
- Local development: Use `localhost` URLs (default)
- Kubernetes: Use service names (see comments in .env.example)
- Docker Compose: Use container names

### 🔌 Real Threads API Integration (NEW!)
```bash
# Enable real posting to Threads (replaces fake-threads)
# 1. Get credentials from Meta Developer Dashboard
# 2. Configure in chart/values-dev.yaml
# 3. See full setup guide:
cat docs/threads-api-setup.md

# Quick test:
just threads-health          # Check API connection
just threads-test-post       # Post to real Threads
just threads-refresh-metrics # Get engagement data
```

### 💰 Revenue Infrastructure (NEW!)
```bash
# Complete monetization system with 3 revenue streams:
# 1. Affiliate commissions (auto link injection)
# 2. Lead capture (email + scoring)
# 3. Subscriptions ($29/$97/$297 tiers)

# Configuration:
# - Set Stripe keys in values-dev.yaml
# - Revenue service auto-enhances all content
# - Real-time analytics at /revenue/analytics

# Quick revenue check:
just revenue-dashboard       # View revenue metrics
just revenue-forecast        # 12-month projection
```
