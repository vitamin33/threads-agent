# Future Tests

This directory contains test files for features that are planned but not yet implemented.

## Emotion Trajectory Mapping Tests (CRA-282)

The following test files were created as part of the CRA-282 emotion trajectory mapping feature design:

- `test_emotion_api_integration.py` - API endpoint tests for emotion analysis endpoints
- `test_emotion_database_integration.py` - Database integration tests for emotion models
- `test_emotion_workflow_e2e.py` - End-to-end workflow tests
- `test_emotion_concurrency.py` - Concurrency and performance tests
- `test_emotion_edge_cases.py` - Edge case handling tests
- `test_emotion_ml_models.py` - ML model tests
- `test_emotion_performance.py` - Performance benchmarks

These tests were moved here because:
1. The API endpoints they test don't exist in the viral_pattern_engine service
2. They require a `db_session` fixture that isn't defined
3. The implementation is planned but not yet built

When implementing the emotion trajectory mapping feature, these tests can be moved back and updated to match the actual implementation.
