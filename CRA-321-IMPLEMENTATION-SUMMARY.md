### 🐳 Kubernetes Deployment Status
```bash
$ kubectl get pods -l app=prompt-engineering
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prompt-engineering-6b7f76b666-w4cr9   1/1     Running   0          71m
```

### 🔍 Verified API Endpoints
All endpoints tested and working via port-forward:
- ✅ `GET /health` → {"status":"healthy"}
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/templates` → 25 templates returned
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/experiments` → Active experiments tracked
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/chains/1/execute` → Chain execution successful
- ✅ `GET /metrics` → Prometheus metrics exposed

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights
