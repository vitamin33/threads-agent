# Test: Complexity Scoring and Business Value Extraction

## Summary
This PR tests the fixes for Achievement Tracker system:

1. **Complexity Score Calculation**: Previously all PRs showed 40 (base score). Now should calculate properly based on:
   - Files changed: 134 files = +20 points (≥10 files)
   - Total changes: 4339 changes (320+4019) = +25 points (≥1000 changes)
   - Reviews: 0 reviews = +0 points
   - Expected complexity score: **85** (40 base + 20 files + 25 volume)

2. **Business Value Extraction**: Should work without async errors

## Business Impact
This fix **saves 5 hours per week** of manual achievement review and ensures accurate complexity scoring for **200+ PRs per month**. This represents **$26,000 annual savings** in developer time reviewing and categorizing achievements.

## Performance Improvements
The complexity scoring is **100% more accurate** than the previous flat 40-point system, providing better career progression insights.

## Technical Changes
- Fixed field name mapping in `_calculate_complexity_score()`
- Replaced `asyncio.run()` with `await` in GitHub Actions workflow
- Added support for large PRs (1000+ changes) with higher scoring

## Expected Results
- Complexity Score: 85 (instead of 40)
- Business Value: $26,000 annual savings
- Time Saved: 260 hours/year (5 hours/week × 52 weeks)
- Performance Improvement: 100%
