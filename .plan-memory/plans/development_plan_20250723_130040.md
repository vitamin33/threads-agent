# Memory-Driven Development Plan: reach k MRR with viral content

**Generated:** Wed Jul 23 13:00:42 EEST 2025  
**Timeframe:** medium  
**Context-Aware:** Yes

## ðŸ“Š Current Codebase Context

- **Project type:** microservices_k8s
- **Architecture style:** microservices
- **Service count:** 8
- **Total files:** 66
- **Avg file size:** 271
- **Complexity:** complex

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal-Specific Recommendations

### General Development Recommendations:
- **Incremental Approach:** Break down into manageable iterations
- **Quality First:** Maintain high code quality and test coverage
- **Documentation:** Keep documentation current and comprehensive  
- **Feedback Loops:** Establish rapid feedback and validation cycles
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identify and plan for potential roadblocks

## ðŸš§ Technical Debt Considerations

**Debt Level:** medium

### Debt Remediation Tasks:
- Address 11 large files that may need refactoring
- Resolve 0 TODO/FIXME comments
- Review 4 potential code duplications

**Recommendation:** Address high-priority technical debt before implementing major new features.

## ðŸ’¡ Identified Opportunities

- **TESTING:** Improve test coverage (Priority: medium)
- **PERFORMANCE:** Async optimization potential (Priority: medium)
- **SECURITY:** Review secret management (Priority: high)

## ðŸ“‹ Suggested Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Requirements analysis and technical design
- Environment setup and tooling
- Core architecture implementation

### Phase 2: Implementation (Weeks 3-4)
- Feature development
- Testing and validation
- Integration with existing systems

### Phase 3: Refinement (Weeks 5-6)
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Documentation completion
- Deployment preparation

**Key Deliverables:**
- Production-ready implementation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Full documentation
- Deployment scripts

## ðŸ”„ Integration with Existing Workflows

- **Quality Gates:** Use `just pre-commit-fix` before each commit
- **Testing:** Follow existing test patterns and coverage requirements
- **Deployment:** Leverage current Kubernetes/Helm infrastructure
- **Monitoring:** Integrate with existing observability stack

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

- **Technical:** Code coverage maintenance, build success rate, performance benchmarks
- **Process:** Reduced development cycle time, improved code review efficiency
- **Business:** Feature adoption, user satisfaction, system reliability

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Actions

1. **Immediate (Today):**
   - Review this plan with stakeholders
   - Set up development environment
   - Create initial epic and features

2. **Short-term (This Week):**
   - Begin implementation of highest priority features
   - Set up monitoring and quality gates
   - Establish feedback loops

3. **Medium-term (This Month):**
   - Complete core functionality
   - Conduct thorough testing
   - Prepare for deployment
