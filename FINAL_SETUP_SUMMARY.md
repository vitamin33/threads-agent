# ‚úÖ Complete 4-Agent Parallel Development Setup

## What's Been Configured

### 1. Agent Differentiation ‚úÖ
Each agent now has clear boundaries and responsibilities:
- **A1**: MLOps (MLflow, SLO gates, monitoring)
- **A2**: GenAI (vLLM, RAG, token optimization)
- **A3**: Analytics (achievements, documentation, portfolio)
- **A4**: Platform (A/B testing, revenue, FinOps)

### 2. Real Metrics Only ‚úÖ
- NO MORE FAKE DATA or templates
- Shows "NO DATA AVAILABLE" when services aren't running
- Shows "SERVICE NOT RUNNING" instead of mock metrics
- `collect-real-metrics-v2.sh` validates all data

### 3. Job Strategy Integration ‚úÖ
- AI_JOB_STRATEGY.md integrated into all planning
- Each agent builds specific portfolio artifacts
- Targets specific job roles (MLOps Engineer, GenAI Engineer, etc.)
- All work aligned to $160-220k remote AI roles

### 4. Files That Won't Conflict ‚úÖ
Added to `.gitignore`:
```
.agent.env              # Agent configuration
.ai-context.json        # AI planning context
AGENT_TASKS.md          # Current tasks
.locks/                 # Coordination locks
.metrics/               # Local metrics
.job-tracker/           # Job applications
.portfolio/data/        # Portfolio artifacts
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### One-Time Setup
```bash
cd ~/development/threads-agent
./scripts/agent-worktree-setup.sh
```

### Daily Workflow (Each Warp Window)

#### Window 1 - A1 MLOps
```bash
cd ~/development/wt-a1-mlops
source .agent.env
just ai-morning
just real-metrics    # Check REAL data
```

#### Window 2 - A2 GenAI
```bash
cd ~/development/wt-a2-genai
source .agent.env
just ai-morning
just real-metrics    # Check REAL data
```

#### Window 3 - A3 Analytics
```bash
cd ~/development/wt-a3-analytics
source .agent.env
just ai-morning
just real-metrics    # Check REAL data
```

#### Window 4 - A4 Platform
```bash
cd ~/development/wt-a4-platform
source .agent.env
just ai-morning
just real-metrics    # Check REAL data
```

## üìä Key Commands for Real Data

```bash
# Collect ALL real metrics (no templates)
./scripts/collect-real-metrics-v2.sh all

# Check specific metrics
just slo-check          # Real SLO compliance
just mlflow-status      # Real MLflow models
just vllm-benchmark     # Real vLLM metrics
just job-review         # Real job applications

# Generate portfolio artifacts (only with real data)
just portfolio mlflow-screenshot
just portfolio cost-table
just proof-pack
```

## üéØ What Each Agent Should Tell Claude

### A1 (MLOps):
```
I am Agent A1 working on MLOps.
Services: orchestrator, celery_worker, persona_runtime
Focus: MLflow, SLO gates, monitoring
Ignore: rag_pipeline, achievement_collector, revenue
Build: MLflow demos for MLOps Engineer roles
```

### A2 (GenAI):
```
I am Agent A2 working on GenAI.
Services: rag_pipeline, vllm_service, viral_engine
Focus: vLLM, RAG, token optimization
Ignore: orchestrator, achievement_collector, revenue
Build: Cost reduction proofs for GenAI Engineer roles
```

### A3 (Analytics):
```
I am Agent A3 working on Analytics.
Services: achievement_collector, tech_doc_generator
Focus: Portfolio, documentation, achievements
Ignore: orchestrator, rag_pipeline, revenue
Build: Portfolio website and documentation
```

### A4 (Platform):
```
I am Agent A4 working on Platform.
Services: revenue, finops_engine, event_bus
Focus: A/B testing, revenue, FinOps
Ignore: orchestrator, rag_pipeline, achievement_collector
Build: A/B test results for Platform Engineer roles
```

## ‚úÖ Configuration Locations

1. **CLAUDE.md** (lines 347-395): Agent specializations
2. **`.gitignore`**: Prevents conflicts
3. **`scripts/agent-worktree-setup.sh`**: Creates all configs
4. **`scripts/collect-real-metrics-v2.sh`**: Real data only
5. **Each worktree**:
   - `.agent.env`: Runtime config
   - `.ai-context.json`: AI planning
   - `AGENT_TASKS.md`: Current goals

## üö´ What Won't Happen Anymore

- ‚ùå No fake metrics or template data
- ‚ùå No merge conflicts from agent configs
- ‚ùå No confusion about which services to work on
- ‚ùå No portfolio artifacts without real data
- ‚ùå No work unaligned with job strategy

## üìà Next Priority Actions

1. **Start services**: `just dev-start`
2. **Initialize MLflow**: `mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db`
3. **Deploy vLLM**: `cd services/vllm_service && just deploy`
4. **Collect real metrics**: `just real-metrics`
5. **Generate portfolio**: `just portfolio suggest`
6. **Track applications**: `just job-apply "Company" "Role"`

The system is now fully configured for parallel development with real data only!
