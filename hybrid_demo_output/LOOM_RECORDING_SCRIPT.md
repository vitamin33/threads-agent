# Loom Recording Script - MLOps Portfolio Demo

## Opening (15 seconds)
"Hi, I'm demonstrating an MLOps lifecycle system I built that showcases production model management with real SLO validation and automated rollback capabilities."

## Demo Execution (45 seconds)
[Run the demo - let it execute while narrating]
"This system trains three production ML algorithms - RandomForest, XGBoost, and LogisticRegression - with comprehensive performance monitoring. Notice the real-time SLO validation checking accuracy thresholds and P95 latency requirements."

## Key Features (30 seconds)
[Point to output]
"The system implements automated quality gates - models must meet 75% accuracy and sub-100ms P95 latency to pass. When performance degrades, automated rollback triggers in under 30 seconds. All experiments are tracked in MLflow with full artifact management."

## Portfolio Value (20 seconds)
"This demonstrates production MLOps skills: experiment tracking, performance monitoring, SLO-based deployment gates, and automated lifecycle management - all critical for maintaining ML systems at enterprise scale."

## Closing (10 seconds)
"The complete implementation is available in my portfolio, showcasing real infrastructure integration and production-ready MLOps patterns."
