title: "Hands-On MLflow Experience with Small Model Comparison Framework"
description: |
  Transform theoretical MLflow implementation into hands-on, measured system using small models (TinyLlama-1.1B, Phi-3.5-mini, Llama-3.2-3B).
  Replace simulated metrics with real measurements, implement comprehensive model comparison framework,
  and create A/B testing pipeline for social media optimization. Focus on practical MLflow experience
  for GenAI Engineer portfolio demonstration.
