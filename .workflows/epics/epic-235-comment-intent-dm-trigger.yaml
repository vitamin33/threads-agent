epic_name: "Comment Intent Analysis & DM Trigger System"
description: |
  Implement an intelligent comment monitoring and analysis system that detects purchase intent 
  signals in real-time and automatically triggers personalized DM conversation sequences. This 
  system is a critical component of the DM-to-Purchase Pipeline (E5) and directly feeds into 
  CRA-236 (conversation automation) and CRA-237 (Stripe payments).

  The system analyzes comment text using ML models to score intent level (0-100), identifies 
  high-intent users, and triggers automated DM workflows for revenue conversion. It includes 
  comprehensive attribution tracking to measure conversion from comment to purchase.

  Key technical components:
  - Real-time comment stream monitoring and ingestion
  - ML-powered intent analysis using sentiment and keyword models
  - Intent scoring algorithm with confidence levels
  - DM trigger system with personalized message templates
  - Attribution tracking for comment-to-purchase conversion
  - Integration with existing viral_pattern_engine and revenue service

status: planned  
priority: high
business_value: |
  - Enables automated revenue generation from viral content engagement
  - Directly supports $0.01/follow cost efficiency and $20k MRR targets
  - Provides scalable lead qualification and conversion system
  - Reduces manual effort in identifying high-intent prospects
  - Creates measurable attribution from content engagement to revenue
  - Establishes foundation for advanced conversation automation (CRA-236)
  - Enables data-driven optimization of DM conversion rates

notes: |
  This epic establishes the core infrastructure for automated revenue generation from content 
  engagement. The implementation is designed in phases to enable iterative improvement:
  
  Phase 1: Basic comment monitoring and simple intent detection
  Phase 2: Advanced ML analysis with confidence scoring  
  Phase 3: Personalized DM triggers with A/B testing
  Phase 4: Full attribution tracking and optimization
  
  The system leverages existing ML capabilities in viral_pattern_engine while adding 
  specialized intent analysis models. Integration with revenue service ensures complete 
  attribution tracking from comment engagement to purchase conversion.
  
  Success of this epic directly enables CRA-236 (conversation automation) and CRA-237 
  (Stripe payment integration) by providing the qualified leads and trigger mechanisms.
