title: "Real-Time Operations Center"
description: |
  Comprehensive real-time operations monitoring and control center that provides live visibility
  into pipeline processing, quality gate analytics, service health matrix, and system performance
  across the entire microservices architecture. This system integrates with Kubernetes, Prometheus,
  and existing services to provide operational excellence and proactive issue detection.

  Key capabilities include:
  - Pipeline Processing Monitor with real-time task tracking and bottleneck detection
  - Quality Gate Analytics with failure analysis and optimization recommendations
  - Service Health Matrix with Kubernetes pod status and resource utilization
  - System Performance Dashboard with SLA monitoring and alerting
  - Real-time troubleshooting tools and automated recovery suggestions
  - Cost optimization insights and resource allocation recommendations
