title: "Local vLLM Deployment with Llama-3.1-8B for GenAI Portfolio"
description: |
  Comprehensive local vLLM deployment system using Llama-3.1-8B on MacBook M4 Max, designed 
  specifically for GenAI Engineer portfolio demonstration. This epic transforms the existing 
  vllm_service into a production-grade local deployment with hybrid local+cloud architecture,
  delivering 60% cost savings vs OpenAI API while maintaining quality and performance.

  Portfolio Value: This demonstrates advanced GenAI engineering skills including local LLM deployment,
  performance optimization, cost engineering, and hybrid architecture design - all critical for
  $150-250k GenAI Engineer roles.
