epic_name: "PR Value Metrics Calculation Transparency & Database Enhancement"
description: |
  Enhance the Achievement Collector database to provide comprehensive transparency for PR value 
  metrics calculations, including formula storage, baseline tracking, calculation provenance,
  and confidence scoring. This epic builds upon the existing PR Value Analyzer integration
  to create a robust, auditable system for tracking how business/technical metrics are calculated.

  The current system stores 40+ metrics (ROI, infrastructure savings, UX scores) in JSON fields
  but lacks transparency into how these values are calculated, their input parameters, and
  baseline comparisons. This epic adds the missing calculation metadata and audit trail.

status: planned
priority: high
business_value: |
  - Provides transparency and auditability for PR value calculations (critical for executive reporting)
  - Enables historical tracking of calculation formula evolution and accuracy improvements
  - Supports confidence scoring for metric reliability in portfolio presentations
  - Reduces technical debt by properly structuring complex metrics data
  - Enables advanced analytics and metric validation across achievement history
  - Supports data-driven improvements to calculation algorithms

success_metrics:
  - "All PR metrics include calculation formulas and input parameters"
  - "100% of calculations are traceable with version history"
  - "Baseline comparisons available for all quantitative metrics"
  - "Confidence scores assigned to all calculated metrics"
  - "Database migration completes without data loss"
  - "Performance impact <5% for existing queries"
  - "API response times remain <200ms for metric endpoints"

dependencies:
  - "Existing PR Value Analyzer integration"
  - "Achievement Collector database with PRAchievement tables"
  - "PostgreSQL migration system in orchestrator service"
  - "Existing metrics_after and metadata JSON fields"

risks:
  - "Large data migration may require downtime"
  - "Complex JSON schema changes could break existing integrations"
  - "Performance impact from additional metadata storage"
  - "Backwards compatibility with existing metric consumers"

mitigation_strategies:
  - "Implement database migrations in phases with rollback capability"
  - "Add comprehensive schema validation for JSON structure changes"
  - "Performance testing with production-scale data volumes"
  - "Maintain backwards compatibility through versioned APIs"

notes: |
  This epic is structured in 3 phases to minimize risk and enable incremental delivery:
  
  Phase 1 (Quick Wins): Enhance existing JSON structure with minimal database changes
  Phase 2 (Core Enhancement): Add dedicated calculation metadata table with full audit trail  
  Phase 3 (Advanced Features): Implement confidence scoring and advanced analytics
  
  The approach leverages existing PR Value Analyzer integration while adding transparency
  and auditability that executives and technical stakeholders require for trust in metrics.
