title: "Content Scheduler Service Integration Architecture"
description: |
  Comprehensive service integration layer that connects the Content Scheduler Pipeline
  with all existing threads-agent microservices. This epic implements an event-driven
  architecture that enables intelligent content generation, automated quality optimization,
  and real-time performance tracking across the entire content lifecycle.
  
  Key Integration Points:
  - Viral Engine: Pattern optimization and quality scoring
  - Achievement Collector: Content sourcing and performance tracking
  - Pattern Analyzer: Fatigue detection and freshness scoring
  - RAG Pipeline: Contextual content enhancement
  - Persona Runtime: Multi-persona content generation
  - Tech Doc Generator: Documentation and reporting
  
  This integration transforms Content Scheduler from a standalone tool into the
  central hub of an AI-powered content ecosystem.
