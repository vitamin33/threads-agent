epic_name: "Intelligent Conversation State Machine & DM Automation"
description: |
  Build a new intelligent conversation automation microservice that manages 7-state conversation 
  flows from initial contact to purchase completion. This system handles 80% of DM interactions 
  autonomously using GPT-4o for personalized responses, maintains conversation context across 
  sessions, and integrates with PostgreSQL for persistence and Redis for ultra-fast state caching.

  The conversation state machine implements sophisticated workflow orchestration across these states:
  1. INITIAL_CONTACT - First touchpoint and greeting
  2. INTEREST_QUALIFICATION - Understanding user needs and pain points
  3. VALUE_PROPOSITION - Presenting tailored solutions and benefits
  4. OBJECTION_HANDLING - Addressing concerns and building trust
  5. PRICE_NEGOTIATION - Discussing pricing and packages
  6. CLOSING_ATTEMPT - Moving toward purchase decision
  7. POST_PURCHASE - Follow-up and satisfaction confirmation

  Technical architecture includes intelligent context management, GPT-4o integration for 
  natural language generation, Redis-based state caching for <5 second response times, 
  PostgreSQL for conversation persistence, and sophisticated transition logic with 
  fallback to human agents for complex scenarios.
