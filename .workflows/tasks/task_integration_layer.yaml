description: |
  Build robust integration between achievement_collector and tech_doc_generator services with standardized APIs, error handling, and performance monitoring.

  ## Implementation Checklist
  - Design standardized API contracts between services with OpenAPI specs
  - Implement FastAPI integration endpoints with proper error handling
  - Create shared data models using Pydantic for type safety
  - Build async HTTP client for cross-service communication with retry logic
  - Add comprehensive integration tests with >90% coverage
  - Implement performance monitoring with Prometheus metrics
  - Set up distributed tracing with Jaeger for request flow visibility
  - Create health check endpoints for service discovery
  - Add rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns for resilience
