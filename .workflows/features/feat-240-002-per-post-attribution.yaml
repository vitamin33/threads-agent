# Feature: Per-Post Cost Attribution System
name: "Per-Post Cost Attribution System"
epic: "epic-240-finops-cost-tracking-optimization"
type: "feature"
priority: "high"
estimated_effort: "large"
lifecycle_stage: "planning"

# Detailed Description
description: "Implement precise per-post cost attribution that tracks all costs from content generation through publication. Provides exact cost breakdown for each viral post including AI generation, processing, storage, and distribution costs with full audit trail."

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria: |
  - Every post has complete cost attribution from generation to publication
  - Cost breakdown shows: AI tokens, infrastructure, processing, storage
  - Attribution accuracy within 5% margin of actual costs
  - Real-time cost updates as post progresses through pipeline
  - Historical cost analysis and trending for posts
  - API endpoints for cost queries by post ID
