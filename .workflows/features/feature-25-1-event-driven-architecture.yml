acceptance_criteria:
  - Event bus implemented with RabbitMQ
  - Event store with PostgreSQL for persistence
  - Event routing and filtering mechanisms
  - Dead letter queue handling
  - Event replay capability
  - Comprehensive event schema registry

technical_tasks:
  - task-25-1-1-event-bus-setup
  - task-25-1-2-event-store-implementation
  - task-25-1-3-event-routing-system
  - task-25-1-4-event-schema-registry
  - task-25-1-5-error-handling-dlq
  - task-25-1-6-event-replay-mechanism

dependencies:
  - RabbitMQ infrastructure
  - PostgreSQL event store tables
  - Redis for event caching

testing_requirements:
  - Unit tests for event handlers
  - Integration tests for event flow
  - Load tests for event throughput
  - Failure scenario testing
