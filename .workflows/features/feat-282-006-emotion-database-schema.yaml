# Storage Optimization Strategy
storage_optimization:
  compression:
    trajectory_data: "gzip compression for JSONB fields"
    historical_data: "archive old data to compressed storage"
    analytics_cache: "in-memory caching for frequent queries"
    
  partitioning:
    emotion_trajectories: "partition by analysis_timestamp (monthly)"
    emotion_performance: "partition by measured_at (monthly)"
    template_usage: "partition by usage_date (yearly)"
    
  archiving:
    retention_policy: "keep 2 years of detailed data, summarize older"
    archive_schedule: "monthly archiving of data older than 6 months"
