# Feature: Real-time Cost Data Collection Engine
name: "Real-time Cost Data Collection Engine"
epic: "epic-240-finops-cost-tracking-optimization"
type: "feature"
priority: "high"
estimated_effort: "large"
lifecycle_stage: "planning"

# Detailed Description
description: "Implement comprehensive real-time cost data collection across all viral content operations. Track OpenAI API usage, Kubernetes resource consumption, and external service costs with sub-second granularity and reliable attribution."

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria: |
  - OpenAI API costs tracked per request with token count and model pricing
  - Kubernetes resource costs collected via metrics API with per-pod attribution
  - All cost events stored with correlation IDs for post attribution
  - Cost collection adds <10ms latency to critical paths
  - 99.9% reliability for cost data capture
  - Real-time cost streaming to monitoring dashboard
