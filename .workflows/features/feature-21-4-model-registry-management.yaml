title: "MLflow Model Registry Management"
description: |
  Implement comprehensive MLflow Model Registry for managing small models lifecycle.
  Enable model versioning, staging (development/staging/production), and automated
  model promotion based on performance criteria. Create hands-on model registry experience.

      Automate model registration from vLLM service:
      - Register models automatically on first load
      - Create model versions with metadata (size, architecture)
      - Tag models with performance characteristics
      - Implement model signature and schema validation
    acceptance:

      Create model staging system:
      - Development stage for newly registered models
      - Staging stage for models passing quality gates
      - Production stage for best-performing models
      - Archived stage for deprecated models
    acceptance:
      - "Model staging transitions working correctly"

      Implement intelligent model promotion:
      - Define promotion criteria (latency, quality, cost)
      - Automatic promotion based on performance thresholds
      - A/B testing integration for promotion validation
      - Rollback capability for failed promotions
    acceptance:
      - "Promotion criteria configurable and enforced"

      Enable vLLM service to use models from registry:
      - Load models by registry name and version
      - Respect staging constraints (only load production/staging)
      - Cache registry metadata for performance
      - Update model switching to use registry
    acceptance:
      - "vLLM loads models from MLflow registry"
      - "Staging constraints properly enforced"
      - "Registry metadata cached efficiently"
      - "Model switching uses registry versions"
