### **⏰ MINUTE 2: Real-Time Dashboard & Architecture (60 seconds)**

#### **🎬 Action 3: Streamlit Dashboard (30 seconds)**

**Switch to: http://localhost:8503**

**Step 1 - Dashboard Overview (5s):**
**🗣️ Say:** *"This is my custom MLOps monitoring dashboard built with Streamlit"*

**Step 2 - Run Live Demo (15s):**
- Click "🚀 Run Demo" button
- Show real-time logs streaming
- Point to status changing to "Demo Running..."

**🗣️ Say:** *"Real-time pipeline execution with live logging and monitoring"*

**Step 3 - Performance Metrics (10s):**
- Show model comparison results
- Point to SLO compliance indicators
- Highlight automated winner selection

**🗣️ Say:** *"Automated A/B testing with SLO-based quality gates and performance monitoring"*

#### **🎬 Action 4: Production Architecture (30 seconds)**

**Switch back to terminal - show artifacts:**
```bash
cat demo_output/README_DEMO.md
ls -la demo_output/
```

**🗣️ Key Architecture Points:**
> "This demonstrates production-ready architecture with:
> - **PostgreSQL backend** for concurrent MLflow access
> - **Kubernetes deployment** with Helm charts
> - **Automated rollback** under 30 seconds SLO
> - **Prometheus monitoring** integration
> - **Complete audit trails** for enterprise compliance
> 
> The pipeline includes experiment tracking, model registry, SLO validation, and performance monitoring - exactly what enterprises need for production ML systems at scale."
