# ðŸš€ AI Development System Activation Guide

## âœ… PR MERGED - Now activate across all 4 agent worktrees

### **Step 1: Update All Agent Worktrees**
```bash
# Navigate to each agent and update with merged changes:

# A1 - Infrastructure & Platform
cd ../wt-a1-mlops
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main  # Get enhanced AI system
export AGENT_ID="a1"

# A2 - AI/ML & Content  
cd ../wt-a2-genai
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main  # Get enhanced AI system
export AGENT_ID="a2"

# A3 - Data & Analytics
cd ../wt-a3-analytics
git fetch origin main  
git merge origin/main  # Get enhanced AI system
export AGENT_ID="a3"

# A4 - Revenue & Business
cd ../wt-a4-platform
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main  # Get enhanced AI system
export AGENT_ID="a4"
```

### **Step 2: Activate AI System on Each Agent**
```bash
# In each agent worktree:
just start       # Complete AI session setup + learning activation
# âœ… Loads agent-specific context
# âœ… Activates learning system  
# âœ… Starts quality gates
# âœ… Enables ultra-friendly commands
```

### **Step 3: Test Enhanced Commands**
```bash
# Test ultra-friendly commands:
just save        # AI-powered commit (replaces script names)
just agents      # View all 4 agent status dashboard

# Test service group assignments:
just infra       # â†’ A1 (Infrastructure & Platform)
just ai          # â†’ A2 (AI/ML & Content)
just data        # â†’ A3 (Data & Analytics)  
just revenue     # â†’ A4 (Revenue & Business)
```

### **Step 4: Test TDD Integration**
```bash
# Test TDD system:
just tdd "payment processing"    # Complete TDD cycle with AI
just test-first "authentication" # Generate failing test + stub
just tdd-watch                  # Start continuous testing
# (Press Ctrl+C to stop watcher)
just tdd-stop                   # Stop test watcher
```

### **Step 5: Test Learning System**
```bash
# Activate learning across all agents:
just learn-activate    # Enable command tracking and pattern analysis
just dev-insights      # View development analytics and metrics
```

## ðŸ§ª **Daily Workflow (Post-Activation)**

### **Morning (30 seconds)**
```bash
# Choose your agent based on today's work:
cd ../wt-a1-mlops     # Infrastructure work
cd ../wt-a2-genai     # AI/ML work
cd ../wt-a3-analytics # Data/Analytics work  
cd ../wt-a4-platform  # Business/Revenue work

# Start AI-powered session:
export AGENT_ID="a1"  # or a2, a3, a4
just start            # Complete setup + learning + context
```

### **During Development**
```bash
# Use ultra-friendly commands:
just save             # AI-powered commit
just tdd "feature"    # TDD for critical features
just quick-save       # Emergency checkpoint

# Switch between service groups:
just infra           # Work on infrastructure
just ai              # Work on AI/ML services
just data            # Work on analytics
just revenue         # Work on business logic
```

### **Evening (30 seconds)**
