## üåÖ **DAILY WORKFLOW**

### **Morning Routine (2 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Start AI-powered development session
just start
# ‚úÖ Auto-loads context, starts quality gates, begins learning tracking

# 2. Check job strategy alignment  
just align
# ‚úÖ Syncs your focus with job market priorities
```

### **Development Work (Ultra-Friendly Commands)**
```bash
# Instead of long script names, use these:
just save          # Quick AI-powered commit
just ai            # AI-generated commit message  
just commit        # Intelligent commit with quality gates
just quick-save    # Emergency checkpoint (bypasses quality)
just done          # Session complete + focus update
```

### **Quality Gates (Automatic)**
```bash
# These run automatically with every commit:
# ‚úÖ Code formatting (ruff)
# ‚úÖ Type checking (mypy)  
# ‚úÖ Security scan (bandit)
# ‚úÖ Test validation
# ‚úÖ Learning system tracking
# ‚úÖ Focus update based on work patterns
```

### **Evening Wrap-up (1 minute)**
```bash
# 1. Complete session with AI analysis
just finish
# ‚úÖ Stops watchers, updates focus, tracks session metrics

# 2. Check weekly progress toward job goals
just progress  
# ‚úÖ Generates report aligned with AI_JOB_STRATEGY.md
```

export AGENT_ID="a1" && just align  # MLOps focus
export AGENT_ID="a2" && just align  # GenAI focus  
export AGENT_ID="a3" && just align  # Analytics focus
export AGENT_ID="a4" && just align  # Platform focus
```

### **Tuesday-Thursday: Focused Development**

# A1: MLflow + SLO-gated CI (Priority 1-2)
# A2: vLLM cost optimization (Priority 3)  
# A3: Portfolio + achievement documentation
# A4: A/B testing + revenue metrics (Priority 5)
```

### **Friday: Integration & Portfolio**
```bash
# 1. Merge agent work
just agent-merge  # From each agent worktree
