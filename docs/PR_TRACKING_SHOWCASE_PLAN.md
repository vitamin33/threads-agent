## Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Over-engineering the frontend** - Keep it simple
2. **Perfect aesthetics** - Focus on functionality first
3. **Too many features** - Better to have 3 polished features than 10 rough ones
4. **Complex animations** - They take more time than expected

### If You Fall Behind
- Cut features, not quality
- Focus on PR analyzer + basic dashboard
- Polish what you have vs adding more
- Use templates where possible

## The Bottom Line

You have a **goldmine** in your achievement_collector service. The backend is production-ready and sophisticated. You just need a visual layer to make it shine.

**In 2-3 weeks, you can have:**
- Live dashboard showing your quantified impact
- Interactive PR analyzer for demos
- Professional portfolio for sharing
- Compelling story backed by real data

This is **completely achievable** because you're not building from scratch - you're adding a presentation layer to an already powerful system.

**Start with the simplest version that impresses, then iterate.**
