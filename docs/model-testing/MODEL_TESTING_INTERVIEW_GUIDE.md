model_config = registry.get_model_config("bloom_560m")

# 2. Download Management
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,      # Apple Silicon optimization
    device_map="mps",               # Metal Performance Shaders
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True         # Memory optimization
)
```

#### **Phase 2: Performance Measurement**
```python
# 3. Real Performance Testing
import time
import psutil

# Memory baseline
memory_before = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / (1024**3)

# Timed inference
start_time = time.time()
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)
inference_time_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000

# Memory usage
memory_after = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / (1024**3)
model_memory_gb = memory_after - memory_before
```

#### **Phase 3: Business Content Evaluation**
```python
# 4. Content Quality Assessment
def assess_business_quality(content: str, content_type: str) -> float:
    score = 5.0
    words = content.split()
    
    # Length optimization for business content
    if content_type == "linkedin_post":
        if 100 <= len(words) <= 300:  # Optimal LinkedIn length
            score += 3.0
    
    # Professional vocabulary assessment
    business_terms = ["optimization", "strategy", "implementation"]
    term_count = sum(1 for term in business_terms if term in content.lower())
    score += min(2.0, term_count * 0.4)
    
    return min(10.0, score)
```

#### **Phase 4: MLflow Experiment Tracking**
```python
# 5. Comprehensive Metrics Logging
import mlflow

with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f"business_test_{model_name}"):
    # Technical metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("inference_latency_ms", inference_time_ms)
    mlflow.log_metric("memory_usage_gb", model_memory_gb)
    mlflow.log_metric("tokens_per_second", tokens_generated / (inference_time_ms/1000))
