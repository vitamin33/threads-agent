## ‚ö†Ô∏è **WHAT NEEDS REAL TESTING**

### **Performance Claims (PROJECTED, NOT MEASURED):**
- ‚ùå **<50ms inference** - Target goal, not tested with real models
- ‚ùå **Metal backend performance** - Code exists, not validated
- ‚ùå **Memory usage with real models** - Tested with 0.1GB simulated, not 4-16GB real

### **Cost Claims (ESTIMATED, NOT MEASURED):**
- ‚ùå **99.9% cost savings** - Calculation based on OpenAI pricing vs projected local costs
- ‚ùå **$36k annual savings** - Mathematical projection, not real usage data
- ‚ùå **Electricity costs** - Estimated, not measured

### **Scale Claims (DESIGNED, NOT TESTED):**
- ‚ùå **5 models simultaneously** - Logic supports it, not tested with real memory usage
- ‚ùå **Memory constraint handling** - Algorithm exists, not validated with real constraints

## üéØ **HONEST INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS**

### **What to Say:**
*"I built a comprehensive multi-model deployment architecture and validated the coordination logic with extensive testing. The system is designed for Apple Silicon optimization and ready for real model deployment."*

**Architecture Achievement:**
*"I eliminated 50% code duplication by consolidating 6 separate model registry implementations into a unified, extensible architecture using composition patterns."*
