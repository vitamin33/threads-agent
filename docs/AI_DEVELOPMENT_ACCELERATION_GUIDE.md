**Time Saved:** 2-3 hours per day (no context switching)

### **3. OPENAI** - AI-Assisted Development
```bash
just dev-assist "implement rate limiting"
```
**What it does:**
- Generates AI prompts with full context
- Includes codebase patterns and recent work
- Ready for Claude Code, ChatGPT, or Cursor
- Follows existing code conventions

**Time Saved:** 30-50% on new feature development

### **4. GOOGLE DEEPMIND** - Smart Testing
```bash
just dev-quality
```
**What it does:**
- Tests only changed modules (targeted testing)
- Progressive quality gates (fail fast)
- Performance baseline tracking
- <30 second full quality check

**Time Saved:** 5-15 minutes per commit cycle

### **5. ALL COMPANIES** - Development Insights
```bash
just dev-insights
```
**What it does:**
- Code complexity analysis
- Productivity scoring
- Session duration tracking
- Agent performance metrics

**Time Saved:** Eliminates manual progress tracking

## ⚡ Complete Workflow Examples

### **Morning Startup (2 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Load AI context for Claude Code
just dev-context

# 2. Start file watcher for instant feedback
just dev-watch

# 3. Get development insights from yesterday
just dev-insights
```

### **Feature Development (Ongoing)**
```bash
# 1. Generate AI prompt for new feature
just dev-assist "add user role management"

# 2. Code with real-time feedback (watch running)

# 3. Quality check before commit
just dev-quality

# 4. Commit and auto-update context
git commit -m "feat: add user roles"
# (AI context auto-updates via pre-commit hook)
```

### **End of Day (1 minute)**
```bash
# 1. Stop file watcher
just dev-stop

# 2. Final insights and metrics
just dev-insights

# 3. Merge to main if ready
just agent-merge
```

## 🎮 Custom Claude Code Commands

Add to `.claude/custom-commands.json`:

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "dev-boost": {
      "description": "AI development acceleration",
      "command": "just dev-boost",
      "icon": "🚀"
    },
    "dev-assist": {
      "description": "AI code generation prompt",
      "command": "just dev-assist \"{{prompt}}\"",
      "icon": "🤖",
      "variable": "prompt"
    }
  }
}
```
