# Build and deploy
just bootstrap
docker build -t orchestrator:local -f services/orchestrator/Dockerfile .
k3d image import orchestrator:local -c threads-agent
kubectl rollout restart deployment/orchestrator

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs orchestrator-<pod-id>
kubectl exec orchestrator-<pod-id> -- python3 -c "test commands"

# Test endpoints
kubectl port-forward svc/orchestrator 8081:8080
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

CRA-235 has been successfully implemented, tested, and deployed to the local k3d cluster. All performance targets have been met, and the system is ready for production use.
