## Project Overview

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> "I built a production-grade AI agent system that generates viral social media content. It uses LangGraph for orchestration, tracks business KPIs like engagement rate and cost-per-follower, and includes full observability from LLM tokens down to database queries. The system achieved 6%+ engagement rates while keeping costs under $0.01 per follower."

### Business Impact
- **Target KPIs**: 6%+ engagement, <$0.01/follow, $20k MRR
- **Scale**: 150+ personas, 45k+ API requests processed
- **Cost Optimization**: Token usage tracking, caching strategies
- **Revenue Streams**: Affiliate marketing, lead generation, subscriptions

### Technical Highlights
- **Microservices**: FastAPI, Celery, LangGraph
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes (k3d), Helm charts, GitOps
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4, prompt optimization, quality scoring
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, business & technical metrics

## Monitoring & Observability

### Three-Layer Monitoring Strategy

#### 1. Business Metrics (What matters to stakeholders)
```python
# Key metrics we track:
posts_engagement_rate      # Target: 6%+
cost_per_follow_dollars   # Target: <$0.01
revenue_projection_monthly # Target: $20k
viral_posts_total         # Posts with >10% engagement
```

#### 2. Application Metrics (Service health)
```python
http_request_duration_seconds  # API latency
llm_tokens_total              # AI costs
content_generation_latency    # Pipeline performance
posts_generated_total         # Volume metrics
```

#### 3. Infrastructure Metrics (System health)
```python
rabbitmq_queue_messages      # Queue depth
pg_stat_database_numbackends # DB connections
container_cpu_usage          # Resource utilization
```

### Monitoring Architecture Decisions

**Why Prometheus + Grafana?**
- Industry standard, rich ecosystem
- PromQL for complex queries
- Handles high cardinality well

**Why separate monitoring stack for dev?**
> "I optimized for rapid iteration. The standalone stack lets me test monitoring changes without redeploying the cluster. In production, we'd use prometheus-operator for tighter integration."

**Why track business metrics in Prometheus?**
> "Technical metrics don't tell the whole story. By tracking engagement rate alongside latency, we can see if performance improvements actually impact business outcomes."

## Key Talking Points

### 1. Production Thinking
> "Every service exposes metrics from day one. We learned from a production incident where we couldn't debug slow API responses because we weren't tracking database query latency."

### 2. Cost Awareness
> "We track every OpenAI API call by model and service. This helped us identify that switching from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5-turbo for body generation saved 70% on costs with minimal quality impact."

### 3. Scalability Design
> "The system uses Celery for async processing, which lets us scale workers independently. During peak hours, we can add more workers without touching the API layer."

### 4. AI Engineering
> "We use LangGraph for complex workflows because it provides better observability than raw LangChain. Each node in the graph emits metrics, so we can optimize bottlenecks."

### 5. DevOps Excellence
> "The entire stack runs on k3d locally with the same Helm charts we'd use in production. This caught several configuration issues before they hit staging."

```

## Common Interview Questions

### Q: "What was the most challenging part of this project?"

**A:** "Balancing content quality with cost. Initially, we used GPT-4 for everything and burned through budget. We implemented a tiered approach: GPT-4 for hooks (high impact), GPT-3.5 for bodies (good enough), and aggressive caching. This cut costs by 70% while maintaining engagement rates."

### Q: "How do you handle failures?"

**A:** "Multiple layers:
1. Service level: Circuit breakers for external APIs
2. Queue level: Dead letter queues for failed tasks  
3. Data level: Idempotent operations, transaction logs
4. Monitoring: Alerts on error rates, not just errors"

### Q: "Why not use Airflow instead of Celery?"

**A:** "Celery is better for high-volume, low-latency tasks. Airflow excels at complex DAGs but has higher overhead per task. Since we process thousands of content generation requests, Celery's lightweight model was a better fit. We do use Airflow for daily batch jobs like analytics."

### Q: "How would you scale this to 1M users?"

**A:** "The architecture already supports horizontal scaling:
1. Stateless services: Add more pods
2. Queue-based processing: Add more workers
3. Database: Read replicas, connection pooling
4. Caching: Redis cluster for hot data
5. CDN: Cache generated content at edge"

### Q: "What would you do differently?"

**A:** "Three things:
1. Start with stricter type checking (Pydantic everywhere)
2. Implement distributed tracing earlier (Jaeger)
3. Build the feedback loop first (engagement → quality model)"

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Microservices over Monolith
**Context**: Need to scale different components independently
**Decision**: Separate services for orchestration, AI, and persistence
**Consequences**: More complex deployment, but better scalability

### ADR-002: LangGraph over LangChain
**Context**: Need observable, testable AI workflows
**Decision**: Use LangGraph for structured persona workflows
**Consequences**: Better debugging, but steeper learning curve

### ADR-003: PostgreSQL over MongoDB
**Context**: Need flexible schema with strong consistency
**Decision**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for semi-structured data
**Consequences**: Best of both worlds - flexibility + ACID

### ADR-004: Prometheus over CloudWatch
**Context**: Need portable monitoring solution
**Decision**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
**Consequences**: More setup, but vendor-agnostic and powerful

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Connection pooling (100 connections max)
   - Indexed JSONB fields for fast queries
   - Materialized views for analytics

3. **Service Communication**
   - gRPC for internal services (considering)
   - HTTP/2 for API gateway
   - Message batching in RabbitMQ

### Performance Metrics
- API p95 latency: <100ms
- Content generation: <5s per post

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures
1. **API Security**: Rate limiting, JWT tokens, CORS
2. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest, TLS in transit
3. **Secret Management**: K8s secrets, environment separation
4. **Access Control**: RBAC, service accounts

### Security Interview Responses
> "We follow OWASP guidelines and implement defense in depth. For example, even though services are internal, they still authenticate with each other using service tokens."
