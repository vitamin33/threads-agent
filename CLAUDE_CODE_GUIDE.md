## üîß Best Practices

### Business-First Development

#### ‚úÖ Always Validate Business Value First
```bash
# Before any significant development
just roi-calculator "feature idea" estimated_hours 150 expected_revenue impact_level
just next-customer-priority  # Confirm priority alignment
```

#### ‚úÖ Customer-Context Code Generation
```bash
# Generate code with customer intelligence
just ci-dashboard           # Check customer behavior
just code-for-retention    # Get retention recommendations
code "feature that addresses customer behavior insights"
```

#### ‚úÖ Track Business Outcomes
```bash
# After implementing features
just cc-feedback feature_implementation completed impact_score
just track-behavior "user123" "feature_use" "new_feature" duration
```

### Token Efficiency with Business Intelligence

#### Efficient Development Pattern:
```bash
# 1. Business context (5 minutes, high-value tokens)
just business-morning

# 2. Validated development (efficient, targeted)
just next-customer-priority
code "specific business-validated requirement"

# 3. Quality delivery (automated, efficient)
just ship "feat: business-validated feature"

# 4. Impact tracking (learning, future efficiency)
just cc-feedback work completed impact_score
```

### Context Leveraging

#### ‚úÖ Use Memory System for Context
```bash
# Leverage existing codebase context
just memory-analyze         # Understand architecture
memory-epic "new feature"   # Generate context-aware plan
code "feature that follows existing patterns"
```

#### ‚úÖ Business Intelligence Integration
```bash
# Combine systems for maximum context
just cc                     # Unified priorities
just ci-dashboard          # Customer context
code "feature based on business priorities and customer behavior"
```

### Progressive Development Complexity

#### Level 1: Quick Business Validation (Minimal tokens)
```bash
just cc                     # Quick priority check
just next-customer-priority # Fast recommendation
```

#### Level 2: Targeted Business Development (Focused tokens)
```bash
just roi-calculator "feature" hours rate revenue impact
code "business-validated specific feature"
```

#### Level 3: Comprehensive Business Analysis (When needed)
```bash
just weekly-strategic-review    # Complete analysis
just compare-features "A" "B"   # Detailed comparison
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Business Intelligence Issues

#### Problem: ROI calculations seem inaccurate
```bash
# Solution: Calibrate with actual results
just cc-feedback previous_feature completed actual_impact_score
just bi-report monthly  # Review historical accuracy
```

#### Problem: Customer intelligence not updating
```bash
# Solution: Verify data flow
just track-behavior "test_user" "test_action" "test_page" 60
just ci-dashboard  # Should show updated data
```

### Integration Issues

#### Problem: Unified command center not showing data
```bash
# Solution: System synchronization
just memory-sync            # Sync all systems
just cc-generate           # Regenerate priorities
```

#### Problem: Business morning briefing incomplete
```bash
# Solution: Initialize all systems
just memory-analyze        # Initialize memory system
just daily-insights        # Initialize customer intelligence
just business-morning      # Should now show complete data
```

### Claude Code + Platform Integration

#### Problem: Code generation not business-aware
```bash
# Solution: Ensure business context first
just business-morning      # Get business context
just next-customer-priority # Get specific priority
code "feature aligned with business priority"
```

#### Problem: Priorities seem misaligned
```bash
# Solution: Feedback calibration
just cc-feedback recent_work completed actual_impact
# System learns and improves recommendations
```

## üìö Integration Patterns

### Epic-to-Deployment with Business Intelligence

```bash
# 1. Business-validated epic planning
just roi-calculator "Epic Name" total_hours 150 expected_revenue high
pm-epic "Business-Validated Epic Name" > epic.json
