- `variant_kills` - Early kill history
- `variants` - Variant content and predictions
- `dashboard_events` - Event audit trail

## Performance Metrics

- **Dashboard Load**: < 1 second
- **WebSocket Latency**: < 100ms
- **Concurrent Connections**: 500+ supported
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB under load

## Key Features Delivered

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection provides instant updates
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Live engagement rate tracking
3. **Early Kill System**: Immediate notifications of terminated variants
4. **Pattern Analysis**: Fatigue detection and warnings
5. **AI Recommendations**: Smart optimization suggestions
6. **Scalable Architecture**: Supports high concurrent usage
