# Achievement Auto-Collection System

## Overview
The Achievement Auto-Collection system automatically tracks and creates achievements from your development work across multiple sources:
- Git commits and pull requests
- Linear issues and epics
- MLflow experiments (pending E4.5 implementation)

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Git Commit Tracker** (`services/achievement_collector/services/git_tracker.py`)
   - Monitors git commits for significant changes
   - Creates achievements based on commit type, size, and impact
   - Extracts skills from file changes
   
2. **Linear Tracker** (`services/achievement_collector/services/linear_tracker.py`)
   - Tracks completed Linear issues and epics
   - Creates achievements with priority-based impact scores
   - Extracts skills from labels and descriptions
   
3. **Auto Tracker Coordinator** (`services/achievement_collector/services/auto_tracker.py`)
   - Manages all tracking services
   - Handles graceful startup/shutdown
   - Configurable via environment variables

### Data Flow
```
Git Commits ‚Üí Git Tracker ‚Üò
                           ‚Üí Achievement Database ‚Üí Export/Publishing
Linear Issues ‚Üí Linear Tracker ‚Üó
```

## Setup and Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Git Tracking
GIT_REPO_PATH=.                    # Repository to monitor
MIN_LINES_FOR_ACHIEVEMENT=50       # Minimum lines changed for achievement
ENABLE_GIT_TRACKING=true           # Enable/disable git tracking

# Linear Tracking  
LINEAR_API_KEY=your_key            # Linear API key (uses MCP in production)
LINEAR_CHECK_INTERVAL=3600         # Check interval in seconds

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...       # Achievement storage
```

### Git Hook Setup
To track commits in real-time, add to `.git/hooks/post-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
python3 scripts/track-commit-achievement.py
```

## Usage

### Start Auto-Tracker
```bash
# Development/testing
python3 scripts/start-achievement-tracker.py

# Production (with proper environment)
python3 -m services.achievement_collector.services.auto_tracker
```

### Test Individual Components
```bash
# Test Linear tracker with mock data
python3 scripts/test-linear-tracker.py

# Test simple achievement functionality
python3 scripts/test-achievement-simple.py
```

## Achievement Creation Logic

### Git Commits
Commits are considered significant if they:
- Match conventional commit patterns (feat, fix, perf, etc.)
- Change more than MIN_LINES_FOR_ACHIEVEMENT lines
- Contain keywords like "implement", "build", "deploy"

### Linear Issues
Issues create achievements with:
- Category based on labels (feature, bugfix, performance, etc.)
- Impact score based on priority (Urgent: 90, High: 75, Medium: 60)
- Complexity score based on estimate points
- Skills extracted from labels and description

### Scoring System
- **Impact Score**: 0-100 based on priority and scope
- **Complexity Score**: 0-100 based on effort and technical depth
- **Portfolio Ready**: Achievements with impact >= 70

## Next Steps

### Pending Implementation
1. **LinkedIn Auto-Publisher** (Task 3)
   - OAuth integration
   - Post formatting
   - Scheduling logic

2. **GitHub Profile Updater** (Task 4)
   - README generation
   - Stats aggregation
   - Auto-commit

3. **Celery Scheduling** (Task 5)
   - Periodic publishing
   - Rate limiting
   - Retry logic

### MLflow Integration (After E4.5)
When MLOps Foundation epic is complete:
```python
# In auto_tracker.py
if os.getenv("MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI"):
    tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(self.mlflow_tracker.track_experiments()))
```

## API Integration

### Internal Achievement Creation
```python
from services.achievement_collector.api.schemas import AchievementCreate
from services.achievement_collector.api.routes.achievements import create_achievement_sync

achievement = AchievementCreate(
    title="Completed: Feature Implementation",
    category="feature",
    description="Implemented new OAuth flow",
    source_type="git",
    source_id="commit_hash",
    impact_score=75.0,
    complexity_score=80.0,
    skills_demonstrated=["Python", "OAuth", "Security"]
)

db = next(get_db())
result = create_achievement_sync(db, achievement)
```

## Monitoring

The system logs all activities:
- `‚úÖ` Successful achievement creation
- `‚ÑπÔ∏è` Skipped non-significant items  
- `‚ùå` Errors with full traceback
- `üîç` Processing status updates

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest services/achievement_collector/tests/

# E2E tests (requires database)
pytest services/achievement_collector/tests/ -m e2e
```
