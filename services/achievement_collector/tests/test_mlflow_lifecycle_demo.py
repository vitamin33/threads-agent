"""
Test suite for MLflow Lifecycle Demo following TDD principles.

This test suite defines the complete behavior for a comprehensive MLflow demo
that showcases: train→eval→promote→rollback workflow with SLO gates.

The demo must be suitable for 2-minute Loom recording and demonstrate
production-ready MLOps practices including:
- Multiple model training (RandomForest, XGBoost, LogisticRegression)
- Model evaluation with metrics comparison
- Stage promotion with SLO validation (p95 latency < 500ms)
- Automated rollback with performance monitoring
- Visual outputs for portfolio demonstration
