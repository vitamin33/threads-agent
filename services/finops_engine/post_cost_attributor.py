"""
PostCostAttributor - Per-Post Cost Attribution System (CRA-240)

Implements precise cost-post associations with:
- 95% accuracy target for cost attribution
- Full audit trail for cost tracking
- Integration with existing ViralFinOpsEngine
- Sub-second query performance

Requirements:
1. Track costs per individual viral post with precise breakdown
2. Link costs to specific posts from generation through publication
3. Store cost-post associations in PostgreSQL
4. Provide programmatic interface for cost queries
