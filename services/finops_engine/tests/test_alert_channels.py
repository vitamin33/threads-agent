"""
Test suite for Alert Channel Manager (CRA-241)

Following TDD methodology to implement multi-channel alert system with:
- Slack, Discord, Telegram, and custom webhook support
- Parallel processing for <60s SLA
- Rich formatting per channel type
- Graceful handling of missing configurations
- Retry logic for failed alerts
- Severity-based color coding

Target: Sub-60s alert delivery with 99.9% reliability.
