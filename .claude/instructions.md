## IMPORTANT: Start Here!

When working on this codebase, **ALWAYS** use the mega productivity commands. They combine multiple operations and save 80% of time.

## ðŸŽ¯ The 80/20 Commands You MUST Use

### Daily Development
```bash
just work-day        # Use this EVERY morning
just create-viral    # For content generation (replaces 5+ manual commands)
just ship-it         # For deployments (replaces test + deploy + PR)
just end-day        # Use this EVERY evening
```

### Business/Money Focus
```bash
just make-money     # Runs business on autopilot
just ai-biz         # Check business metrics
just grow-business  # Analyze and activate growth
```

- `just check` + `just smart-deploy` + `just ship` â†’ Use `just ship-it`
