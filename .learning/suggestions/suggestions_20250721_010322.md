## 🎯 Personalized Suggestions

### Immediate Optimizations
- 🌙 **Late hours detected** - Consider shorter, focused tasks to maintain code quality
- ⚠️ **High failure rate** - Try running `just pre-commit-fix` before complex operations
- 🔄 **Break down workflows** - Consider splitting complex tasks into smaller steps
- 💾 **Uncommitted changes detected** - Consider `just ship "<message>"` to save progress
- 🚨 **Frequent failure:** `just` - Check logs or try alternative approach

### Workflow Optimizations
- 🧪 **Quality gates:** Use `just pre-commit-fix` for auto-fixing + validation
- 🔍 **Testing:** Run `just test-watch` for continuous feedback
- 📊 **Monitoring:** Check `just health` for system status

### Learning Insights
- 📈 **Command analysis** available in learning patterns
- 🔄 **Workflow patterns** analyzed and saved

### Next Steps
1. Review failing patterns: `learning-system.sh analyze-failures`
2. Check optimization impact: `learning-system.sh benchmark`
3. Export insights: `learning-system.sh report`
